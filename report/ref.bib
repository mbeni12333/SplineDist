abstract = {Segmenting 3D cell nuclei from microscopy image volumes is critical for biological and clinical analysis, enabling the study of cellular expression patterns and cell lineages. However, current datasets for neuronal nuclei usually contain volumes smaller than $10^{\text{-}3}\ mm^3$ with fewer than 500 instances per volume, unable to reveal the complexity in large brain regions and restrict the investigation of neuronal structures. In this paper, we have pushed the task forward to the sub-cubic millimeter scale and curated the NucMM dataset with two fully annotated volumes: one $0.1\ mm^3$ electron microscopy (EM) volume containing nearly the entire zebrafish brain with around 170,000 nuclei; and one $0.25\ mm^3$ micro-CT (uCT) volume containing part of a mouse visual cortex with about 7,000 nuclei. With two imaging modalities and significantly increased volume size and instance numbers, we discover a great diversity of neuronal nuclei in appearance and density, introducing new challenges to the field. We also perform a statistical analysis to illustrate those challenges quantitatively. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel hybrid-representation learning model that combines the merits of foreground mask, contour map, and signed distance transform to produce high-quality 3D masks. The benchmark comparisons on the NucMM dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation approaches.

abstract = {In the past few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved
milestones in medical image analysis. Especially, the deep neural networks
based on U-shaped architecture and skip-connections have been widely applied in
a variety of medical image tasks. However, although CNN has achieved excellent
performance, it cannot learn global and long-range semantic information
interaction well due to the locality of the convolution operation. In this
paper, we propose Swin-Unet, which is an Unet-like pure Transformer for medical
image segmentation. The tokenized image patches are fed into the
Transformer-based U-shaped Encoder-Decoder architecture with skip-connections
for local-global semantic feature learning. Specifically, we use hierarchical
Swin Transformer with shifted windows as the encoder to extract context
features. And a symmetric Swin Transformer-based decoder with patch expanding
layer is designed to perform the up-sampling operation to restore the spatial
resolution of the feature maps. Under the direct down-sampling and up-sampling
of the inputs and outputs by 4x, experiments on multi-organ and cardiac
segmentation tasks demonstrate that the pure Transformer-based U-shaped
Encoder-Decoder network outperforms those methods with full-convolution or the
combination of transformer and convolution. The codes and trained models will

Our approach proceeds by introducing a fixed number of labels (colors) and then
dynamically assigning object instances to those labels during training

network that can color previously unseen images. At test time, individual
object instances can be recovered from the output of the trained convolutional
network using simple connected component analysis. In the experimental

Thus, quantitative analysis of changes in size and shape of nuclear structures in 3D microscopic images is important not only for investigating nuclear organization, but also for detecting and treating pathological conditions such as cancer. While many efforts have been made to develop cell and nuclear shape characteristics in 2D or pseudo-3D, several studies have suggested that 3D morphometric measures provide better results for nuclear shape description and discrimination. A few methods have been proposed to classify cell and nuclear morphological phenotypes in 3D, however, there is a lack of publicly available 3D data for the evaluation and comparison of such algorithms. This limitation becomes of great importance when the ability to evaluate different approaches on benchmark data is needed for better dissemination of the current state of the art methods for bioimage analysis. To address this problem, we present a dataset containing two different cell collections, including original 3D microscopic images of cell nuclei and nucleoli. In addition, we perform a baseline evaluation of a number of popular classification algorithms using 2D and 3D voxel-based morphometric measures. To account for batch effects, while enabling calculations of AU-ROC and AUPR performance metrics, we propose a specific cross-validation scheme that we compare with commonly used k-fold cross-validation.

abstract = {Instance segmentation of biological images is essential for studying object behaviors and properties. The challenges, such as clustering, occlusion, and adhesion problems of the objects, make instance segmentation a non-trivial task. Current box-free instance segmentation methods typically rely on local pixel-level information. Due to a lack of global object view, these methods are prone to over- or under-segmentation. On the contrary, the box-based instance segmentation methods incorporate object detection into the segmentation, performing better in identifying the individual instances. In this paper, we propose a new box-based instance segmentation method. Mainly, we locate the object bounding boxes from their center points. The object features are subsequently reused in the segmentation branch as a guide to separate the clustered instances within an RoI patch. Along with the instance normalization, the model is able to recover the target object distribution and suppress the distribution of neighboring attached objects. Consequently, the proposed model performs excellently in segmenting the clustered objects while retaining the target object details. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on three biological datasets: cell nuclei, plant phenotyping dataset, and neural cells.},

Importantly, we take one step further by dynamically learning the mask head of
the object segmenter such that the mask head is conditioned on the location.
Specifically, the mask branch is decoupled into a mask kernel branch and mask
feature branch, which are responsible for learning the convolution kernel and
the convolved features respectively. Moreover, we propose Matrix NMS (non
maximum suppression) to significantly reduce the inference time overhead due to
NMS of masks. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in
one shot, and yields better results. We demonstrate a simple direct instance

Therefore, the mechanisms governing cellular locomotion have been under intense scrutiny over the last 50 years. One of the main tools of this scrutiny is live-cell quantitative imaging, where researchers image cells over time to study their migration and quantitatively analyze their dynamics by tracking them using the recorded images. Despite the availability of computational tools, manual tracking remains widely used among researchers due to the difficulty setting up robust automated cell tracking and large-scale analysis. Here we provide a detailed analysis pipeline illustrating how the deep learning network StarDist can be combined with the popular tracking software TrackMate to perform 2D automated cell tracking and provide fully quantitative readouts. Our proposed protocol is compatible with both fluorescent and widefield images. It only requires freely available and open-source software (ZeroCostDL4Mic and Fiji), and does not require any coding knowledge from the users, making it a versatile and powerful tool for the field. We demonstrate this pipeline's usability by automatically tracking cancer cells and T cells using fluorescent and brightfield images. Importantly, we provide, as supplementary information, a detailed step-by-step protocol to allow researchers to implement it with their images.

abstract = {Single cell segmentation is critical and challenging in live cell imaging
data analysis. Traditional image processing methods and tools require
time-consuming and labor-intensive efforts of manually fine-tuning parameters.
Slight variations of image setting may lead to poor segmentation results.
Recent development of deep convolutional neural networks(CNN) provides a
potentially efficient, general and robust method for segmentation. Most
existing CNN-based methods treat segmentation as a pixel-wise classification
problem. However, three unique problems of cell images adversely affect
segmentation accuracy: lack of established training dataset, few pixels on cell
boundaries, and ubiquitous blurry features. The problem becomes especially
severe with densely packed cells, where a pixel-wise classification method
tends to identify two neighboring cells with blurry shared boundary as one
cell, leading to poor cell count accuracy and affecting subsequent analysis.
Here we developed a different learning strategy that combines strengths of CNN
and watershed algorithm. The method first trains a CNN to learn Euclidean
distance transform of binary masks corresponding to the input images. Then
another CNN is trained to detect individual cells in the Euclidean distance
transform. In the third step, the watershed algorithm takes the outputs from
the previous steps as inputs and performs the segmentation. We tested the
combined method and various forms of the pixel-wise classification algorithm on
segmenting fluorescence and transmitted light images. The new method achieves
similar pixel accuracy but significant higher cell count accuracy than

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of cell nuclei in microscopic images is an essential yet challenging source of biological and pathological information. The major challenge is accurate detection and segmentation of densely packed nuclei in images acquired under a variety of conditions. Mask R-CNN-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art nucleus segmentation. However, the current pipeline requires fully annotated training images, which are time consuming to create and sometimes noisy. Importantly, nuclei often appear similar within the same image. This similarity could be utilized to segment nuclei with only partially labeled training examples. We propose a simple yet effective region-proposal module for the current Mask R-CNN pipeline to perform few-exemplar learning. To capture the similarities between unlabeled regions and labeled nuclei, we apply decomposed self-attention to learned features. On the self-attention map, we observe strong activation at the centers and edges of all nuclei, including unlabeled nuclei. On this basis, our region-proposal module propagates partial annotations to the whole image and proposes effective bounding boxes for the bounding box-regression and binary mask-generation modules. Our method effectively learns from unlabeled regions thereby improving detection performance. We test our method with various nuclear images. When trained with only 1/4 of the nuclei annotated, our approach retains a detection accuracy comparable to that from training with fully annotated data. Moreover, our method can serve as a bootstrapping step to create full annotations of datasets, iteratively generating and correcting annotations until a predetermined coverage and accuracy are reached.

abstract = {We present a novel formulation for B-spline snakes that can be used as a tool for fast and intuitive contour outlining. We start with a theoretical argument in favor of splines in the traditional formulation by showing that the optimal, curvature-constrained snake is a cubic spline, irrespective of the form of the external energy field. Unfortunately, such regularized snakes suffer from slow convergence speed because of a large number of control points, as well as from difficulties in determining the weight factors associated to the internal energies of the curve. We therefore propose an alternative formulation in which the intrinsic scale of the spline model is adjusted a priori; this leads to a reduction of the number of parameters to be optimized and eliminates the need for internal energies (i.e., the regularization term). In other words, we are now controlling the elasticity of the spline implicitly and rather intuitively by varying the spacing between the spline knots. The theory is embedded into a multiresolution formulation demonstrating improved stability in noisy image environments. Validation results are presented, comparing the traditional snake using internal energies and the proposed approach without internal energies, showing the similar performance of the latter. Several biomedical examples of applications are included to illustrate the versatility of the method. {\textcopyright} 2000 IEEE.},

More precisely, the Hermite snake construction allows introducing sharp corners in the snake curve and designing directional energy functionals relying on local orientation information in the input image. Using the formalism of spline theory, the model is shown to meet practical requirements such as invariance to affine transformations and good approximation properties. Finally, the dependence on initial conditions and the robustness to the noise is studied on synthetic data in order to validate our Hermite snake model, and its usefulness is illustrated on real biological images acquired using brightfield, phase-contrast, differential-interference-contrast, and scanning-electron microscopy.},

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other HE-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images.},

It not only provides the classes of the image objects, but also provides the location of the image objects which have been classified.

Each pixel is labelled according to the object class within which it is enclosed. Furthering this evolution, instance segmentation gives different labels for separate instances of objects belonging to the same class. Hence, instance segmentation may be defined as the technique of simultaneously solving the problem of object detection as well as that of semantic segmentation.

Due to the large within-class and small between-class variance in pixel values of objects of interest, this remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have started being used in remote sensing applications and demonstrate state of the art performance for pixel level classification of objects. \textcolor{black}{Here we propose a reliable framework for performant results for the task of semantic segmentation of monotemporal very high resolution aerial images. Our framework consists of a novel deep learning architecture, ResUNet-a, and a novel loss function based on the Dice loss. ResUNet-a uses a UNet encoder/decoder backbone, in combination with residual connections, atrous convolutions, pyramid scene parsing pooling and multi-tasking inference. ResUNet-a infers sequentially the boundary of the objects, the distance transform of the segmentation mask, the segmentation mask and a colored reconstruction of the input. Each of the tasks is conditioned on the inference of the previous ones, thus establishing a conditioned relationship between the various tasks, as this is described through the architecture's computation graph. We analyse the performance of several flavours of the Generalized Dice loss for semantic segmentation, and we introduce a novel variant loss function for semantic segmentation of objects that has excellent convergence properties and behaves well even under the presence of highly imbalanced classes.} The performance of our modeling framework is evaluated on the ISPRS 2D Potsdam dataset.

Recent successful learning-based approaches include per-pixel cell segmentation with subsequent pixel grouping, or localization of bounding boxes with subsequent shape refinement. In situations of crowded cells, these can be prone to segmentation errors, such as falsely merging bordering cells or suppressing valid cell instances due to the poor approximation with bounding boxes. To overcome these issues, we propose to localize cell nuclei via star-convex polygons, which are a much better shape representation as compared to bounding boxes and thus do not need shape refinement. To that end, we train a convolutional neural network that predicts for every pixel a polygon for the cell instance at that position.

Because the cells in embryos are considerably crowded, an algorithm to segment individual cells in detail and accurately is needed. To quantify the nuclear region of every cell from a time-series 3D fluorescence microscopic image of living cells, we developed QCANet, a convolutional neural network-based segmentation algorithm for 3D fluorescence bioimages. We demonstrated that QCANet outperformed 3D Mask R-CNN, which is currently considered as the best algorithm of instance segmentation. We showed that QCANet can be applied not only to developing mouse embryos but also to developing embryos of two other model species. Using QCANet, we were able to extract several quantitative criteria of embryogenesis from 11 early mouse embryos. We showed that the extracted criteria could be used to evaluate the differences between individual embryos. This study contributes to the development of fundamental approaches for assessing embryogenesis on the basis of extracted quantitative criteria.},

abstract = {Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in volumetric (3D) fluorescence microscopy datasets is an important step in many biomedical research projects. Although many automated methods for these tasks exist, they often struggle for images with low signal-to-noise ratios and/or dense packing of nuclei. It was recently shown for 2D microscopy images that these issues can be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape representation (star-convex polygon) for cell nuclei. In this paper, we adopt and extend this approach to 3D volumes by using star-convex polyhedra to represent cell nuclei and similar shapes. To that end, we overcome the challenges of 1) finding parameter-efficient star-convex polyhedra representations that can faithfully describe cell nuclei shapes, 2) adapting to anisotropic voxel sizes often found in fluorescence microscopy datasets, and 3) efficiently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra (required for non-maximum suppression). Although our approach is quite general, since star-convex polyhedra include common shapes like bounding boxes and spheres as special cases, our focus is on accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrate on two challenging datasets that our approach (StarDist-3D) leads to superior results when compared to classical and deep learning based methods.},

abstract = {Most contemporary approaches to instance segmentation use complex pipelines involving conditional random fields, recurrent neural networks, object proposals, or template matching schemes. In our paper, we present a simple yet powerful end-to-end convolutional neural network to tackle this task. Our approach combines intuitions from the classical watershed transform and modern deep learning to produce an energy map of the image where object instances are unambiguously represented as basins in the energy map. We then perform a cut at a single energy level to directly yield connected components corresponding to object instances. Our model more than doubles the performance of the state-of-the-art on the challenging Cityscapes Instance Level Segmentation task.},

@article{Walter2020,
abstract = {Instance segmentation of overlapping objects in biomedical images remains a
largely unsolved problem. We take up this challenge and present MultiStar, an
extension to the popular instance segmentation method StarDist. The key novelty
of our method is that we identify pixels at which objects overlap and use this
information to improve proposal sampling and to avoid suppressing proposals of
truly overlapping objects. This allows us to apply the ideas of StarDist to
images with overlapping objects, while incurring only a small overhead compared
to the established method. MultiStar shows promising results on two datasets
and has the advantage of using a simple and easy to train network architecture.},

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {The morphology of glands has been used routinely by pathologists to assess
the malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate segmentation of glands from
histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics
for quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep
contour-aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified
multi-task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual
features from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary
supervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi-task
regularization during the training, the discriminative capability of
intermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not
only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours
simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland
segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied
to large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to
generate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating. Our method won
the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge out of 13 competitive teams,
surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin.},

@article{Molnar2016,
abstract = {The identification of fluorescently stained cell nuclei is the basis of cell detection, segmentation, and feature extraction in high content microscopy experiments. The nuclear morphology of single cells is also one of the essential indicators of phenotypic variation. However, the cells used in experiments can lose their contact inhibition, and can therefore pile up on top of each other, making the detection of single cells extremely challenging using current segmentation methods. The model we present here can detect cell nuclei and their morphology even in high-confluency cell cultures with many overlapping cell nuclei. We combine the “gas of near circles” active contour model, which favors circular shapes but allows slight variations around them, with a new data model. This captures a common property of many microscopic imaging techniques: the intensities from superposed nuclei are additive, so that two overlapping nuclei, for example, have a total intensity that is approximately double the intensity of a single nucleus. We demonstrate the power of our method on microscopic images of cells, comparing the results with those obtained from a widely used approach, and with manual image segmentations by experts.},

@article{Dunn2019,
abstract = {The scale of biological microscopy has increased dramatically over the past ten years, with the development of new modalities supporting collection of high-resolution fluorescence image volumes spanning hundreds of microns if not millimeters. The size and complexity of these volumes is such that quantitative analysis requires automated methods of image processing to identify and characterize individual cells. For many workflows, this process starts with segmentation of nuclei that, due to their ubiquity, ease-of-labeling and relatively simple structure, make them appealing targets for automated detection of individual cells. However, in the context of large, three-dimensional image volumes, nuclei present many challenges to automated segmentation, such that conventional approaches are seldom effective and/or robust. Techniques based upon deep-learning have shown great promise, but enthusiasm for applying these techniques is tempered by the need to generate training data, an arduous task, particularly in three dimensions. Here we present results of a new technique of nuclear segmentation using neural networks trained on synthetic data. Comparisons with results obtained using commonly-used image processing packages demonstrate that DeepSynth provides the superior results associated with deep-learning techniques without the need for manual annotation.},
