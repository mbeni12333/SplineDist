\section*{Subject}

Cell segmentation is a critical and challenging task in bioimage analysis field. Actually, cell detection is useful for counting, tracking or analyzing their morphology. Recently, several convolutional neural networks models have been proposed to tackle this task, especially the popular Stardist model. While StarDist describes cells as star- convex polygons, which is not always the case, SplineDist uses a more flexible and general representation by modelling objects as planar parametric spline curves.

\section*{Contribution}

After the bibliographic study, the work consists in implementing SplineDist and test it on different modalities of images : fluorescent, phase contrast, immuno chemistry (color images) and compare its performances with the StarDist model already integrated in Icy \url{http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org}.
