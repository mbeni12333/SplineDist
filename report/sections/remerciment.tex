\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr.Jean-christoph for this opportunity, it was a life changing experience, despite being intensive at some points, I enjoyed every day of doing research and interacting with lab members, and I will always cherish these moments.\\

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr.Vannary for her consistent guidance and support  during this project, she introduced me to many new fields that stimulated my scientific curiosity and got me out of my comfort zone for my own good, and I'm very grateful.\\

I would like to thank all the members of Laboratory Pasteur who welcomed me and shared with me their experience in research, which cleared my mind and helped me decide of pursuing a career in this field.\\

I would particularly thank Marie-anne who, from the first day I contacted her for the position application, provided fast replies and clear instructions. She went through so much effort handling annoying paperwork just to let me start on time. Her presence in the lab made the days more calm and enjoyable.\\

I'm also grateful to Tru who I never met in person, but provided support for GPU machines which he maintains in his own personal time even when he was on vacation, I really respect his cause and I wish him the best.\\

I would like to thank my parents and family who supported my decisions, for being proud of me, and caring about me. Even if we may be distant from each other, our hearts are as close as ever, I'm extremely grateful I have you.\\

I would like to dedicate this work to my deceased Grandmother and Aunt due to Coronavirus, they were a big part of my life, they provided me with unconditional love. I'm infinitely grateful, and I will never forget their memory, may their souls rest in peace.\\

Last but not least I would like to thank my fianc√© Yasmine who by her hard work and dedication inspired me to finish this project. I overwhelmed her with explanations of my project that she probably didn't understand, but she still kept listening to me, and that actually made me have clearer ideas in my head. she kept worrying about my health and well-being, and is extremely proud of me. I appreciate all her efforts and I'm extremely grateful.\\
