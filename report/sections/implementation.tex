\chapter{Implementation}
We implement our model using Pytorch-lightning library (which is a higher level API for pytorch) and Opencv (for image processing operations) 

\section{Data augmentation}
We use image mirroring both horizontally and vertically (we mirror the ground truth contour accordingly)
\section{ICY software}
Icy is a software to do image analysis, and is mainly oriented toward the analysis of biological images. As a further step to this project, we are currently adapting the code into a compatible plugin for inference. The plugin is made with java and TensorFlow (which only require 2 files, one for the model definition, and the second for the weights).

\section{How to train on a new dataset}
SplineDist expects the new dataset to provide (objectProbas, contours, objectOverlap) 

We use a pretrained Mask RCNN model on DSB18 dataset from 
\section{MASK RCNN and StarDist}
We use the official codebase of stardist found at \url{https://github.com/stardist/stardist},
For Mask RCNN we use directly the results reported by the main paper
